\section{Description of data sets}
\label{sec:papertag.data}

Transcripts of all episodes of \textit{Star Trek: The Original Series}, \textit{The Next Generation} and \textit{Deep Space Nine}, as obtained from \href{http://chakoteya.net/StarTrek/index.html}{chakoteya.net} in February 2023. These are the first three live-action series of the Star Trek franchise, originally released from 1966-1969, 1987-1994 and 1993-1999, respectively.

    \caption{Happiness timeseries of the average episode of Star Trek: The Original Series. Episodes are scaled to the length of the shortest episode. All episodes plotted in black, the red line is the average.}
    \label{fig:average_episode_tos}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/localized/average_episode_tng.pdf}
    \caption{Happiness timeseries of the average episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Episodes are scaled to the length of the shortest episode. All episodes plotted in black, the red line is the average.}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/localized/average_episode_ds9.pdf}
    \caption{Happiness timeseries of the average episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Episodes are scaled to the length of the shortest episode. All episodes plotted in black, the red line is the average.}
    \label{fig:average_episode_ds9}
\end{figure}

Visible in \ref{fig:average_episode_tos}, \ref{fig:average_episode_tng} and \ref{fig:average_episode_ds9}: The episodes usually have a happy end in all three series. Average happiness is comparable overall.
